[Random Password Generator](https://frostyfaust.github.io/Random-Password-Gen/)

## Why I made this site
I created this site so that I could display my skills using Javcascript. While utilizing this webpage, the user will be able to click the generate button and will be met with prompts asking how long they wish their password to be and what criteria they would like to include. Once the criteria is filled out, the website will generate a new password for the user with their corresponding criterias. Lastly, the user will be able to click the "copy" button and have the new password copied to their clipboard to have a more user-friendly interface.


## What I learned
While creating this project, I found that I was getting a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Javascript. I used a combination of variables, objects, while statements, if/ else if statements, and function calls. While integrating mutliple functions, I learned how to properly call and return values to use elsewhere within my code. I also utilized the Javascript's Math objects such as Math.random() and Math.floor(). lastly, I got more comfortable using operators like ===, &&, and ||. Overall, after finishing this project, I was able to step away with a more comfortable and better understanding of Javascript.


## Challenges 
One main challenge I had creating this generator was figuring out how to ensure that all the criteria that the user needed in their new password was all included. After some time of researching, I found that I could use if statements to go through the different criterias and incrementaly add random characters fromn the corresponding criteria string and add them to the newly generated password string.
